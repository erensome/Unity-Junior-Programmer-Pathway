## Summary

* In this Unit, you will program a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, you will learn how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming. By the end of the Unit, you will be able to call basic functions, then declare and tweak new variables to modify the results of those functions.

speedometer and RPM display for the car. Also, new gameplay mechanics are implemented too like WheelCollider and using forces to move the car instead of the Translate function.

## Summary

* In this Unit, you will program a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. In order to do this, you will become much more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. In completing this Unit, you will learn how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.

## Additional Branch
* In [Object-Pooling-Prototype-2](https://github.com/erensome/Unity-Junior-Programmer-Pathway/tree/Prototype-2-Object-Pooling) branch I used Object Pooling technique for instantiating foods to optimize my project and make it more performant.

# Bonus Features

- ## Easy

    - Randomly select from a variety of obstacles to spawn. 

- ## Medium

    - Program a double-jump, so the player can jump one additional time once already in the air. Along with this, you could create a new extra tall obstacle that requires a double-jump (maybe two obstacles stacked on top of each other).  

- ## Hard

    - Add a “dash” / “super speed” ability where, if the player is holding a certain key, the player runs faster through the world, matched by a faster running animation. Use Debug.Log to track the player’s increasing score from 0, which should increase twice as fast during “dash” mode, and then stop counting when the game is over, reflecting the player’s score.
	
- ## Expert 

    - Rather than your player starting off running in place with the background moving, have the player walk into frame from the left, then begin running in place alongside the moving background.

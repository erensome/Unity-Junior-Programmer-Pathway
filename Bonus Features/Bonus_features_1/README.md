# Bonus Features

- ## Easy

    - Create stacks, piles, or pyramids of obstacles for the vehicle to drive through

- ## Medium

    - Add a couple of other cars that are automatically driving down the road in the opposite direction, which the player also has to avoid.

- ## Hard

    - Allow the player to press a key on the keyboard to switch camera views. Ideally, the same key would toggle between two views, one above and behind the vehicle, and the other from the perspective of the driver’s seat.

- ## Expert 

    - Transform this into a “local multiplayer” split-screen game with two cars, where one player’s car is controlled by WASD and the other is controlled by the arrow keys.

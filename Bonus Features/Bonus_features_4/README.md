# Bonus Features

- ## Easy

    - Add a new more difficult type of enemy and randomly select which is spawned.

- ## Medium

    - Create a new powerup that gives the player the ability to launch projectiles at enemies to knock them off (or something that automatically fires projectiles in all directions when the powerup is enabled).  

- ## Hard

    - Create a new powerup that allows the player to hop up into the air and smash down onto the ground, sending any enemies nearby flying away from the player. Ideally, the closer an enemy is, the more it should be impacted by the smash. 
	
- ## Expert 

    - After a certain number of waves, program a mini “boss battle,” where the boss has some completely new abilities. For example, maybe the boss can fire projectiles at you, maybe it is extremely agile, or maybe it occasionally generates little minions that come after you.

# Bonus Features

- ## Easy

    - Allow the player to move forward and backwards within a certain range.

- ## Medium

    - Have animals that also spawn from the left and right side of the screen. If one of them hits you, “Game Over” should be logged to the console.  

- ## Hard

    - At the start of the game, display in the console that the player’s Lives = 3 and Score = 0. If the player feeds an animal, increase and display the Score. If the player misses an animal or is hit by one, decrease and display the Lives. When the number of Lives reaches 0, log “Game Over” in the console.

- ## Expert 

    - Display a “hunger bar” on top of each of the animals. Then, each time you feed one of them, the hunger bar fills up a little. Each animal should require different amounts of food to successfully “feed” them. They should only disappear after their hunger bars are full.

## Mission-2: "Counting Prototype"

* In this mission I developed a basic basketball game that player has one minute to score.  
"Count" text in the left-bottom of the screen indicates player's score.
* _Basketball_ and _Basketball Panel_ models in **Prefabs** folder modeled by me at [Blender][blender-link]. You can use for your personal projects or any other purposes.

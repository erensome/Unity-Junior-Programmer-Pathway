## Resource Management Simulation

* In this project, you will implement functionality for a resource management simulation
application. Resource management is at the heart of many genres of games, but simulations are
also commonly used in educational contexts (for example, to explore sustainability and economics)
and in industry. 
* You can review the project brief at this website. [Brief][project-brief]
* I used this project throughout the OOP and Data persistence implementations of the pathway.
